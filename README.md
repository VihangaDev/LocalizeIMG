## What is LocalizeIMG?

LocalizeIMG is a powerful VS Code extension that automatically downloads all remote images in your HTML files and replaces the URLs with local file paths. This makes your web projects more portable, reduces external dependencies, and improves load times when developing locally.

## Features

- **One-Click Download**: Download all remote images from an HTML file with a single command
- **Smart File Naming**: Creates unique filenames based on the image URL to prevent duplicates
- **Content-Type Detection**: Automatically identifies the correct file extension based on the image content
- **Path Updating**: Seamlessly updates your HTML with the correct relative paths to the local images
- **Progress Reporting**: Shows download progress and results in the VS Code interface

## Why Use LocalizeIMG?

- **Portability**: Make your projects fully portable without external dependencies
- **Offline Development**: Continue development without internet access
- **Performance**: Speed up page loads during development
- **Asset Management**: Keep all your project assets in one place
- **Broken Link Prevention**: Avoid broken images if remote sources change or go down
